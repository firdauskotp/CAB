            <p>The purpose of this website is to make the public aware about cancer, its symptoms and how to potentially treat them. The reason for it is 
                because cancer has become a disease that is feared by many. Many people don't know that they have to check for their symptoms and sometimes when
                they meet a doctor, it is already too late. This is due to cancer having a lot of stages with the later ones causing more fatalities.
            </p>
            <p>With this website, I am hopeful that people will be more aware of cancer as this is a serious topic that not many know about</p>
