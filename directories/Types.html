                        <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
                        <p title="Bladder Cancer Intro"> Bladder cancer begins when healthy cells in the bladder lining—most commonly urothelial cells—change and grow out of control, 
                        forming a mass called a tumor. Urothelial cells also line the renal pelvis and ureters. 
                        Cancer that develops in the renal pelvis and ureters is also considered a type of bladder cancer and is often called upper tract bladder cancer. 
                        It is treated in the same way as bladder cancer and is described in this guide. 
                        A tumor can be cancerous or benign. A cancerous tumor is malignant, meaning it can grow and spread to other parts of the body.
                         A benign tumor means the tumor can grow but will not spread. 
                        Benign bladder tumors are rare.

                        <h3>Symptoms</h3>
                        <p title="Bladder Cancer Symptoms">
                            Most of the symptoms effect the bladder. Among them are
                            <h4>
                                <ol style="list-style-type:none;">
                                    <li>Blood or blood clots in the urine</li>
                                    <li>Pain or burning sensation during urination</li>
                                    <li>Frequent urination especially at night</li>
                                    <li>Lower back pain on 1 side of the body</li>
                                </ol>
                            </h4>
                            
                        </p>

                        <h3>Treatment</h3>
                        <h4>Surgery</h4>
                        <p>
                        Surgery is usually used to remove the tumor and some surrounding healthy tissue during an operation. Some options include
                        <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
                                <li>Transurethral bladder tumor resection(TURBT)</li>
                                <li>Radical cystectomy and lymph node dissection</li>
                                <li>Urinary diversion</li>
                        </ul>
                        However, side effects are <strong>
                            longer healing time, infection, mild bleeding and discomfort after surgery,
                            infections or urine leaks after cystectomy or a urinary diversion. If a neobladder has been created, a patient may sometimes be unable to urinate or completely empty the bladder,
                            Men may have erectile dysfunction and damage to the nerves in the pelvis and loss of sexual feeling and orgasm for both men and women.
                        </strong>
                        <h4>Chemotherapy</h4>
                        This is the use of drugs to destroy cancer cells usually by keeping them from growing, dividing and making more ceels. There are two types of
                        chemotherapy that are
                        <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                            <li>Intravesical chemotherapy</li>
                            <li>Systemic chemotherapy</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Immunotherapy</h4>
                        This is designed to boost the body's natural defenses to fight the cancer. There are two kinds of therapy that are 
                        <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                            <li>Local therapy<p>
                                This includes Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) and Interferon (Roferon-A, Intron A, Alferon)
                            </p></li>
                            <li>Systemic therapy<p>
                                This includes immune checkpoint inhibitors
                            </p></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
                        <p title="Breast Cancer Intro"> Cancer begins when healthy cells in the breast change and grow out of control, 
                            forming a mass or sheet of cells called a tumor. A tumor can be cancerous or benign.
                            A cancerous tumor is malignant, meaning it can grow and spread to other parts of the body. 
                            A benign tumor means the tumor can grow but will not spread.

                            Breast cancer spreads when the cancer grows into adjacent organs or other parts of the body or when breast cancer cells 
                            move to other parts of the body through the blood vessels and/or lymph vessels. T
                            his is called a metastasis.

                                    <li>A lump that feels like a hard knot or a thickening in the breast or under the arm. 
                                        It is important to feel the same area in the other breast to make 
                                        sure the change is not a part of healthy breast tissue in that area.</li>
                                    <li>Change in the size or shape of the breast</li>
                                    <li>Nipple discharge that occurs suddenly, is bloody, or occurs in only 1 breast</li>
                                    <li>Physical changes, such as a nipple turned inward or a sore located in the nipple area</li>
                                    <li>Skin irritation or changes, such as puckering, dimpling, scaliness, or new creases</li>
                                    <li>A warm, red, swollen breast with or without a rash with dimpling resembling the skin of an orange, called “peau d'orange”</li>
                                    <li>Pain in the breast, particularly breast pain that does not go away</li>

                        <h4>Lymph node removal and analysis</h4>
                        Lymph nodes can contain cancer cells. Hence sometimes this treatment will be used. There are two kinds of removals that are
                        <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                            <li>Sentinel lymph node biopsy</li>

                        </ul>
                        <h4>Plastic surgery</h4>
                        A different name for this treatment is reconstructive surgery. It is to reconstruct the breast from tissue taken from another part of the body.
                        Some methods include
                        <ul style="list-style-type: none;">

                            Lymphocytes are part of your immune system. They travel around your body in your lymphatic system, 
                            helping you fight infections. This is not to be confused with another kind of blood cancer that is leukemia which affects
                            the blood and bone marrow

                        <h4>Radiation therapy</h4>
                        <p>Radiation therapy is the use of high-energy x-rays,
                             electrons, or protons to destroy cancer cells. 
                             A doctor who specializes in giving radiation therapy to treat cancer 
                             is called a radiation oncologist. 
                            Radiation treatment for NHL is usually external-beam radiation therapy, 
                            which is radiation given from a machine outside the body.</p>
                        <h4>Immunotherapy</h4>
                        <p>Immunotherapy, also called biologic therapy, 
                            is designed to boost the body's natural defenses to fight the cancer. 
                            It uses materials made either by the body or in a laboratory to 
                            improve, target, or restore immune system function.</p>
                        <h4>Targeted therapy</h4>
                        <p>Targeted therapy is a treatment that targets the cancer’s

                             that contributes to cancer growth and survival. 
                             This type of treatment blocks the growth and spread of 
                             cancer cells while limiting damage to healthy cells.</p>

                        <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
                        <p title="Melanoma Cancer Intro"> 
                            This is a type of skin cancer.
                            The deepest layer of the epidermis, located just above the dermis, contains cells called melanocytes. Melanocytes produce the skin’s pigment or color. 
                            <br>
                            Melanoma begins when healthy melanocytes change and grow out of control, 
                            forming a cancerous tumor. A cancerous tumor is malignant, meaning it
                            can grow and spread to other parts of the body. Sometimes, melanoma develops from a normal mole a person already
                            has on their skin. When this happens, the mole will undergo changes that usually can be seen, such as
                            changes in shape, size, color, or the border of the mole.
                            <br>
                            Melanoma can develop anywhere on the body, including the head and neck, the ski
                            n under the fingernails, the genitals, and even the soles of the feet or palms of the hands. 
                            Melanoma may not be colored like a mole. It may have no color or be slightly red, which is called amelanotic melanoma.
                            <br>
                            When found early, melanoma can often be cured with surgery. 
                            However, melanoma is 1 of the most serious forms of skin cancer. 
                            It can grow deep into the skin; this is called invasive melanoma. 
                            It can also invade blood vessels and spread to lymph nodes and distant parts of the body; this is called metastatic melanoma.
                            <br>
                            This section focuses on cutaneous melanoma, 
                            which is melanoma that first develops in the skin. Less commonly, 
                            melanoma can develop in the mucous membranes that line the mouth, the gastrointestinal tract, a woman’s vagina, 
                            and other locations around the body. Melanoma may also develop in the eye.

                        <p title="Melanoma Cancer Symptoms">
                            There is a rule called the <strong>ABCDE</strong> rule. This applies to moles on the skin. If any mole has
                            a symptom from ABCDE, it is advised to visit a doctor. ABCDE refers to

                        <p>
                        Surgery is usually used to remove the tumor and some surrounding healthy tissue during an operation. Some options include
                        <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
                                <li>Wide excision</li>
